# LiveViewFocusedSelectBug

This cleanly demonstrates the bug with the focused `<select>` tag.

Get the Phoenix app running as usual.
Visit home page. It should be "New Carrot" form.
Notice the "Color" select has a blue background, indicating there are no errors.
Type some thing in the "Name" input. The "Color" select becomes red, indicating an error (it is a required field).
So far, this is all OK.
Now select a color, e.g. "red".
Notice the select element is *still red*, indicating an error (there is not actually an error).
Again type in the "Name" input. Now the select becomes blue.

We see that the select element cannot change class while it is focused.
This is the bug.

# Autogenerated README follows:
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
